Topic Protocol and Codebook

Overview:
	(1) Identify the topic of the dialog

Procedure:
    Understand the definition of each topic in advance.

    Start with the first utterance of the dialog, analyse the discussion goal of the dialog and from there identify the topic of the dialog.

    If the topic of the dialog is identified, try to extract the corresponding topic keywords:
	    <Topic> <keywords>
    
    The keywords can be phrases including words or syntax. These keywords can be used to determine the dialog topic.

	If a dialog contains multiple topics, please choose the one that is discussed most.

	The list of topics is further adapted through a discussion of the labelling results.
